You opened your eyes. The strangely red sky emitted blazing lights.

You stood up and realized you were wearing some protective suit.

You entered the spacecraft and found only a box. Then, you opened it and found a device.

The device was disconnected but still might contain helpful information.

You suddenly felt dehydrated and a big hungry.
